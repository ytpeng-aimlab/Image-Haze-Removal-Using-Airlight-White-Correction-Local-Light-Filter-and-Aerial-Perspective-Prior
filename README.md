# Image-Haze-Removal-Using-Airlight-White-Correction-Local-Light-Filter-and-Aerial-Perspective-Prior, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 2019

Light is scattered and absorbed when travelling through atmosphere particles, leading to visibility attenuation for images captured, especially in hazy scenes. In addition, hazy images may suffer from color distortion caused by haze or sandstorm, resulting in a poor visual quality. In order to effectively enhance visibility and correct possible color casts for such images, we propose a new image dehazing algorithm based on an improved haze optical model, which consists of three modules: airlight white correction (AWC), local light filter (LLF), and aerial perspective prior (APP). In the proposed algorithm, the AWC module detects and corrects possible color cast, the LLF module downplays non-hazy bright pixels (e.g., headlight and white objects) for more accurate airlight estimation, and the APP module uses the minimum/maximum channel and their difference for scene transmission estimation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other
state-of-the-art dehazing methods in three ways: 1) our results have better visual quality; 2) our method performs the best in terms of color restoration; and 3) our method is very efficient at removing haze and color casts.
